# This exercise took an hour to try to put simple code into psuedo code.
# Really innefficent and overcomplicates. Should never be used for any kind of problem
# that can be solved in 15 minutes or less.
# Not great practice. Would have been better to practice only when faced with large problems that are strenuous.

# 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
# Casual:
# Given 2 numbers
# Method takes 2 arguments
# Add both arguments together
# Formal:
# START
# # Given 2 numbers as arguments
# PRINT number1 + number2
# END

# 2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
# Casual:
# Given array of strings
# Method takes 1 argument
# Concatenate the strings together with an array method
# Formal:
# START
# # Given array of strings
# array.join
# END

# 3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
# Casual:
# Given array of integers
# Method takes 1 argument
# Return a NEW array that skips every other index from the array [0, 2, 4, 6, etc]
# Formal:
# START
# # Given array of integers
# array.select SET x
# x.odd?
# END
